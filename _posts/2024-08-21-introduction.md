# Introduction
LLMs have been acclaimed as the technology that can drive automation to the next paradigm and promises to transform every business. The last couple of decades have seen software development automate most basic tasks. Now, we are at a landmark juncture where we might be ready to automate the automator (software development) thanks to increasing appetite of LLMs to become better at cognitive tasks.
## What do I want to build here
In this blog series, I will take you on a journey with me to explore how to generate code, how to evaluate the quality of code and hopefully we will reach a stage where we fully understand the capabilities and frailities of modern LLMs at its ability to automate software development.
### Byte sized posts
Each post will be a nugget of information. I intend NOT to create elaborate blogs that are longreads.
## Who am I?
I have worked as a Data Scientist using Python. Hence a lot of focus will be on generating Python code in this series.
